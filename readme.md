My grimly, including the tesing tool, just type "cd testing_tool && ./run_me.sh" in the command line under this directory

I failed it with 20%, but I only miss one case (fixed). This version should be able to pass with 100%.

## Input:
```
10x10* o12
***1******
*       **
* *  **  *
*        *
** ** ** *
*       **
*      ***
**       *
*        *
***2******
```
## Output:
```
10x10* o12
***1******
*  o    **
* *o **  *
* oo     *
**o** ** *
* oo    **
*  o   ***
** o     *
*  o     *
***2******
RESULT IN 10 STEPS!
```
